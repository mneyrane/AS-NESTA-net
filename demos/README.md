# Experiments

The code for the paper is found under `QCBP_TV_Haar/` and the test images are in `images/`. The subfolder(s) named `CC/` correspond to stability experiment code modified to run at a larger scale on [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/) clusters.


## Test image attributions

`brain_512.png` is a brain magnetic resonance image provided from Adcock and Hansen, authors of *Compressive Imaging: Structure, Sampling, Learning* ([link](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108377447)).

`phantom_brain_512.png` is a phantom image from *Realistic Analytical Phantoms for Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging* by Guerquin-Kern, Lejeune, Pruessmann, and Unser ([link](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2011.2174158)). See [this page](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms/mriphantom/) for their code to generate the phantom in MATLAB.
